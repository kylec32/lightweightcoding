# Who am I?

I am Kyle. I am a software engineer and junior software architect. I love all things software engineering
  related and love delivering value to the users of my software. 

# Why this blog?

I started this blog to document my journey in learning and exploring in the vast software development space. I have been given the opportunity to work on a large complex codebase at an architectural level and decided to document the things I learned along the way.
