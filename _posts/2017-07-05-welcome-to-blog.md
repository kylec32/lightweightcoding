Here we are on our maiden voyage of this blog. Recently the more that I have thought about ways I can grow and develop as a software engineer I have come back to the idea of writing a blog. So much more than sharing my own knowledge I believe it will be a great challenge to put down my thoughts and lessons learned in textual form. In so doing I believe it will solidify the things that I learn and hopefully helping people along the way. 

The theme of this blog have no really been completely nailed down but I believe there will be a number of items about archiecture, design patterns, and software engineering topics. So at this point I ask for your patience and invite you along for the ride as we learn together and grow together.
