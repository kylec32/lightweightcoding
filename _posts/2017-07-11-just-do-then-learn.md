Recently as I have thought of the million of things that I want to do and the million more things that I wanted to learn and try out I found myself getting fairly overwhelmed. However the more that I thought about it the more I realized doing none of the things I wanted was about the worst thing I could. One of the things I had wanted to do was start writing a blog. As part of that I decided to see what there was out there about to learn from and I happened upon [John Somez's](https://simpleprogrammer.com) [email course](https://simpleprogrammer.com/blog-course) about setting up a developer blog. Part of what is preached in this email course is to not worry about messing up or doing anything wrong and just start. Decisions are made (strongly encouraging a specific hosting provider with Wordpress (I followed neither of those suggestions. However I see the value as I tried a bunch of different blogging engines before settling on this one.)) I also recently read a short post from [Gregory Brown](https://twitter.com/practicingdev?lang=en) about how he is trying to build a side project he has been thinking about in 30 minute increments which leads to not overthinking things.

The heart of what both of these people are sharing is not to get caught up in the details. If you want to learn something, just start doing it, the learning will come as you go. I'm sure much will change with this blog as I go but at least I have started. That is my invitation to everyone that may be reading this blog right now. Pick something you want to do/try and just go and do it. The learning will come quicker and will stick.
